# ðŸ¦€ rush â€“ A POSIX-Compliant Shell in Rust

This is my second ever Rust Project!

In this project, I am exploring how build a POSIX(Portable Operating System Interface) compliant shell that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like - cd, pwd, echo and more.

Made with no rush, I call it the rush (RUst SHell)!

Through this project, I'm also revisiting concepts like:
- Shell command parsing
- Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)
- Implementation of built-in commands
- Unix process management

**Note**: This was part of a ["Build your own Shell"](https://codecrafters.io) Challenge hosted by [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io).
